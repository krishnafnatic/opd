OnlyOPD is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizing your need for appropriate protection and management of the Personal Data which you share with us.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain the types of information OnlyOPD obtains about users of our Application and/or Services, how the information is obtained, how it is used, how it is disclosed, how you can get access to this information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, the information described in this policy. As such, please review this policy carefully.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to OnlyOPD&rsquo;s Application and Services and becomes effective as soon as you use the Application. Please understand that your attending independent doctor (&ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;) may have different privacy standards and/or policies regarding the use and disclosure of your medical information. Such use and disclosure of your medical information in respect of the services rendered by that Doctor to you will accordingly be subject to that particular Doctors&rsquo; own privacy standards and/or policies.</p>

      <p>1.1.1  The provision of your Personal Data is voluntary. However, if you do not provide us with your Personal Data, we will not be able to process your Personal Data for the Purposes and Additional Purposes outlined below and may not be able to provide you with our Services. We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide information about yourself to us.</p>
      <p>1.1.2  OnlyOPD will collect your Personal Data when you register for the Application, create a profile on our Application, or subscribe to our Services (&ldquo;Register&rdquo;).

      <p>1.1.3  The Personal Data that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Services. When you Register, you will need to provide us with health-related information that a Doctor will need to determine whether he/she is willing to provide medical services to you.</p>
      <p>1.1.4  That Personal Data will be associated with your profile. Any medical information that you provide through the Application briefly describing your symptoms (or those of any minor for whom you request Services) will be sent to a Doctor, if available, to be used for treatment and the processing of your payment for the Visit, and other healthcare operations. Save as provided in this Privacy Policy, OnlyOPD will not use any medical information for any other purpose without your written authorization, which may be communicated through an electronic or digital means.</p>

For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to information you choose to disclose through these interactive features. When an individual chooses to post information that will be publicly disclosed, he or she is responsible for all legal consequences. We are not responsible under any data protection laws for-information that you voluntarily post on a site that can be accessed by others.</p>

      <p>1.3     Medical Information.</p>
      <p>In connecting you with a Doctor to provide you with their medical services in connection with a Visit, the Application may collect Personal Data from you and transmit it electronically. We will use administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the security and privacy of information held in the Application. Our infrastructure is kept in a secured data centre that protects from unauthorized access to the physical servers, backups and any element used to store and/or process personal data. Only authorized personnel can access the data centre. Our systems and databases are backed up regularly to help protect the data in case of an uncontrollable catastrophe. We run our IT computing system on the Microsoft Azure platform. Kindly be informed that some of these servers may be located outside of Malaysia. The data-center(s) that stores our servers has policies and procedures in place designed to safeguard the equipment that our data is stored on. We regularly upgrade our system software to include the latest security features. Our servers are protected by a firewall system, which is designed to keep unwanted traffic or access out of our computer network. We also employ an intrusion prevention service (IPS) provided by a secured data centre operated by a professional company. We also use security methods to determine the identity of each registered user, so that appropriate rights and restrictions can be enforced for that user. Reliable verification of user identity is called &ldquo;authentication&rdquo;. All communications between our Web server, your browser and our mobile apps is encrypted with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to guard against network eavesdroppers. Your password is internally encrypted in our system to prevent unauthorized access to the system. Validations are built throughout the application to capture the most reliable information. Only the last 4 digits of your credit card number is stored on our servers.</p>
      <p>1.4     Cookies.</p>
      <p>Our Application may use cookies and other technologies to collect information. Cookies are small bits of information that our websites place on the hard drive of your computer. We may use cookies to facilitate your login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users.</p>
      <p>1.5     Tracking and/or Analytics Services.</p>
      <p>We may use mobile application tracking and/or analytics services. These services may record unique mobile gestures such as tap, double-tap, zoom, pinch, scroll, swipe and tilt but do not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in the Application. These services do not track your browsing habits across mobile applications that do not use the same services. We are using the information collected by these services to understand user behavior and optimize site performance.</p>
      <p>1.6     Web Beacons.</p>
      <p>We may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we may include web beacons and cookies in our email messages in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.</p>
      <p>1.7     Non-Health/Medical Information.</p>
      <p>We also collect Personal Data that is not health information or medical information (&ldquo;Non-Health/Medical Information&rdquo;) in the form of statistics and information regarding the Application user&rsquo;s statistics and metrics obtained from third party devices (for example, steps, distance, calories burned, GPS coordinates, bat speed, hand speed, swing time, etc.), which may be combined with personal information you submit through the Application and/or Services so that you can fully enjoy the benefits of the Application&rsquo;s tracking, monitoring, and diagnostic tools. We may also request the following optional information as part of your profile so that you can fully enjoy the features and functions of our Services: your weight, height, and gender.</p>

Location data is not required for participation in activities through the Application, and you have the option of declining collection of geolocation data. If you do not wish for your location data to be shared with OnlyOPD, please respond accordingly when prompted on your mobile device, or visit your mobile device settings. Multimedia will only be collected from your device if you affirmatively select it to upload to the application (i.e. you choose an image or video to store within the Application).
