        6.3     Telemedicine Services (chatting and talking with doctor over our app or website)</p>
      <p>(a)      Telemedicine is the delivery of health care services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the healthcare professional (&ldquo;Treating   Provider&rdquo;) are not in the same physical location. At OnlyOPD, we offer such online telemedicine services (&ldquo;telemedicine Services&rdquo;) enabling users to report their health history and engage Treating Providers to obtain medical and healthcare services. All of the Treating Providers who deliver telemedicine Services through OnlyOPD are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you. OnlyOPD does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Treating Providers, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither OnlyOPD nor any third parties who promote the telemedicine Services shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain from a Treating Provider via the telemedicine Services. WHILE WE HAVE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION, THE TELEMEDICINE SERVICES IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A VISIT WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL, AND ANY RELIANCE UPON OR USE OF THIS INFORMATION BY YOU IS AT YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT DISCRETION AND RISK.</p>
      <p>(b)      During your telemedicine consultation with a Treating Provider, details of your health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology, and your Treating Provider may perform a physical examination through these technologies.</p>
      <p>(c)      The telemedicine Services you receive from Treating Providers are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You may form an ongoing treatment relationship with some Treating Providers. However, your initial visit with a Treating Provider will begin as a consultation (e.g. to determine the most appropriate treatment setting for you to     receive care) and will not necessarily give rise to an ongoing treatment relationship. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Treating Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as recommended. We may make arrangements for follow up care either through OnlyOPD or other healthcare providers. You will have direct access to customer support services to follow up on medication reactions, side effects or other adverse events. Among the benefits of our telemedicine Services are improved access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with any health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:</p>
      <p>(i)       In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor  resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health care decision making by the Treating Provider.</p>
      <p>(ii)      Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted by phone or other means of communication.</p>
      <p>(iii)     In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors.</p>
      <p>(iv)     Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, in rare instances, security   protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information.</p>
      <p>(d)      By accepting these Terms of Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following:</p>
      <p>(A)     You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in your care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.</p>
      <p>(B)     You understand and have read OnlyOPD&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, which can be found here: https://onlyOPD.com/privacy/</p>
      <p>(C)     Your Treating Provider may determine that the telemedicine Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide telemedicine services to you through the Site.</p>
